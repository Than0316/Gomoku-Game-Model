EASY GOMOKU Documentation
=======================================

This documentation presents the design and implementation of a Gomoku AI
developed on a reduced 6×6 board with a four-in-a-row winning condition.
The project explores adversarial search methods, including Minimax and
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with a focus on clear game modeling and
heuristic evaluation.
